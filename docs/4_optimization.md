Q: Given the generator framework, and the cost function we've defined, can we optimize our AFE?

Baysian Optimization

I’ve also read about baysian optimization, in which you generate a prior guess at the output distribution of a hard to compute function, and then you poll random points and progressively update your understanding of the output function until you have a good idea. BoTorch can be used for this.
