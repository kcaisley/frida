# Design techniques

- ✅ Unary, double conversion, and non-binary steps (typically x1.8 smaller)
- ✅ RDAC for powering lower voltage LSBs vs attenuating cap
- ❕ MoM != MIM, and POD is best @ 4fF in μm²
- ❌ MoM caps are only 0.6-0.8 fF in the same μm², with worse variation
- ❕ Most non-linearity comes from capacitor mismatch, but isn't a huge deal
- ❕ Gain loss comes from parasitic capacitance
- ✅ Double sample, and use differential cap array
- ✅ Auto-zero comparator, and use a basic dynamic/clocked latch design
- ❌ Async jeapordizes stability of neighbors
- ✅ Share sequencer across all ADCs
- ❌ Interleaving typically not worth it

cdac, resistive division, unitary vs
monotonic sar ADC, doulbe conversion, unitary capacitor
we have done binary and non-binary ADCs (aka 'redundancy', which allows you to ignore matching requirements, and go faster while saving space)
4-unary steps , followed by double conversion step (solution for dynamic error, by sampling twice).
At time zero, all comparators are brought to a high level., then one by one, each cap is lowered. This rejects power supply noise, and avoids the need for pregain even if you want different input ranges.

no ramp ADC, as SAR is better in energy and area per conversion per taime

power supply rejection is cucial, and

comparator runs on the clock, with a constant phase offset as it's redistributed to the

tower, xfab are preferred foundaries of caeleste

they use a simple, single stage comparator normally. For faster applications, an auto-zeroing comparator design could be good.

double conversion

Bonn has also tried segmented CDAC, capacitor back-side biasing.

Caeleste has tried regulation inside each ADC, but it's too big and consumpes too much power.

Speed 400 -> 2800 ADCs, goals is 10000 ADCs
rate 5Mhz, goal is 10Mhz
area 2500*1000Um -> 60x800um, goal 7.5um*200um
energy/conv 2.5nJ -> 155pj, 10pj goal

After the ADC:
subsequent step is to multiplex from ADC to JESD, then from JESD out to CML drives
in this case, the JESD actually uses more power than ADC banks.

The similarities between binary tracking detectors and optical light imagers is that neither are trying to perform high precision spectroscopy of the incident particles. In either case, you mostly know the energy of the particle before hand, and you job is to quantize their position and timing. With light, you'd like to achieve single particle sensitivity, or something close to it. With electrons, you has a good signal to noise, so you just need to worry about charge splitting etc so you require a bin size of maybe of just 25% of the 2-5ke- particle energy, and with high energy particles you typically just want to know if a single hit was above or below a single threshold.

The goal 7.5um\*200um goal is 1500um^2 of area, which is roughly half of a 50umx50um pixel. This means that compact SAR ADCs have similar areas in HEP and image sensors.

# Oct 14: ADC FOM

power / area (power density, < better)
conversions/ time / area (conversion density, > better)

energy / conversion

At low sampling speeds (

the Walden FOM appears is overly optimisitic at 'high resolution'. I think this surely includes a 12-16 SAR adc.

The Schreier FOM fontier at 10Msps (don't multiply by bits) is 185 dB. 160 is 'good' performance, but not SOTA. It begins to drop above 100Msps by -10dB / decade

The Walden FOM is simplye Fj/conversion-step. The SOTA frontier is around ~10 fJ per conversion-step, if below 100Msps Fsnyq. At this is F sampling nyquist

So like ~10 fj/conv-step is HARD and ~1 fJ/conv-step is best in the workd.

As ENOB increases, power typically is increased by 4x per incremental bit (Walden assumes only 2x)

# Oct 16: Helena

To do:

- Tasks:
  - behavioral DAC block is causing problem. Let's use Verilog-A or simulation math afterwards.
  - relative timing of clock vs nset vs comp_p and comp_n at cdac1_unit blocks. (charge suck out, from capacitance)
  - Look for soundness of the timing above.
- Koen is python guy. koen liekens
- Python file for converting v2common.xlsx to .sp file? (Koen?)
- Sharing the ADC notes slides?
- Simulation testbench to properly quantify:
  - variations for application
  - monte-carlo simuations
  - arrays routing from sequencer
  - power supplies
- Design and synthesis of a streaming JESD204B encoder? Where to find verilog implementation?
- Helena acroynm? high speed low energy array HLEA
- Where are seq_dff_prog used?

Bart notes:

- Why 55 linear shrink of tsmc65? A certain customer wanted it.
- How are test benches stored? -> In the .oa file!
- All capacitor bias drivers should switch from high-to-low
- RDAC (optional) used to provide lower voltage bias to LSBs.
- you can have 1 or 2 buffers, and 2or3 sampling switches (the latter are if you reset the reference plate)
- How many unary + double conversion caps?
- Where to place unary + double conversion caps?
- Comparator auto-zeroing, and
- Sequencer now assumes reset, then sample. The reset+sample is "sort of" CDS?
- Modeling of capacitor mis-matches? -> Monte carlo mismatch
- Modeling of parasitics for speed and power consumption -> maybe not worth the effort. (Just assume 0.5x speed and 2x power?)
- Modeling of error creation (crosstalk, substrate noise, supply noise) + subsequent correction?
- NOTE: leaf symbols (which map to primitives) can't have user added params. Only heiarchicaly models which have an underlying schematic support these.
- Note that the in the alphamatized paramters section, the SPICE,OUTPUT section is
- Differential comparison algorithm
  - Pixel level is first reset by transferring into floating diffusion for short period
  - Then transfer gate is shut and pixel starts to integrated on diode while reset level is available on FD?
  - The reset level R is availabe on the column line which is applied to the input of one of the plates
  - Optionally, the reset level is written to both S and R plate, to allow for autozeroing (with buffer feedback in comp to allow auto-zeroing)
  - The pixel is then read, which produces a lower signal level S at the FD, which is buffered and fed to the other ADC plate

Amir notes:

- In our PDKs, MC models show 3-6% variation in min size cap mismatch.
- MoM != MIM.
  - MOM is on lower metal layers, and just uses fringe. Lowest density.
  - MIM is on higher layers, and uses a special dielectric material, not SiO2
- POD caps are linear FOEL devices, simialr to MOS caps but with a modified process step to add an extra layer.
  - They are the highest density, but must be supported by the foundary,
  - they are between poly and diffusion, but need sheidling on sides (Co, V1, v2) and above (from M1)
  - These additional caps add 'gain loss' though, as they reduce the voltage swing for a given Qin.
- Non linearity in INL comes from non-linear caps:
  - primarily the Cdb of the sample switch (drain-to-bulk depletion cap)
  - Also the gate-drain capacitor at input of comparator
  - but non-linearity isn't a huge deal, as pixel non-linearity dominates, and we can calibrate it anyways
  - This can be done across the whole analog chain, and given to customers as a software lookup table.
- Our unit caps are typically around 20 fF.
  - Determined by mismatch, power consumption, area limit, etc
- Freeing top metal layers is super useful for large arrays, as you can route power, control, clockers, sequencer data
- Tspice is quite slow. Eldo and AFS are not the same, but are similar in peformance. AFS just has RF built in.
- You can't realistically run transient noise simulation of an ADC. The best you can do is sweeping input transiently, and with monte-carlo mismatch.
- kTC noise
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson-Nyquist_noise#Thermal_noise_on_capacitors
  - Vn ~ sqrt(kT/C). Noise doesn't come from capacitor (cap has no noise), but does get converted to voltage by then.
  - If you have a input switch, you have one kTC, if you have an input buffer as well, it's noise figure adds an noise is 2 x kTC.
  - For small processes ( below 180nm), and low power design, you can assume you are kTC noise limited.
  - Small processses have better cap matching, so typically mismatch isn't dominant
  - If quantization noise is ~0.3LSB, then we just decrease VLSB until 0.2*LSB or 0.1*LSB of the kTC voltage noise.
  - ^^Past this point, noise will dominate so there is no point.
- SAR layout is typically long and tall. Input buffer+switch at top right. CDAC below-right. Sequencer+driver+decisionFFs on left of CDAC. Comparator small, at top left.
- In 180nm layout area is around 600um x 60um. We want to go much smaller though.

If you want to change models, how does that manifest in code?

And for models modifications like impact ionization, how does you submit the different continuity equation coefficients by B
