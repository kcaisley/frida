# System simulation

Given a small system of equations to solve, tools like SciPy will attempt to solve them with Newton's method.

If the system become too large, it will then require we use a [Krylov method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Krylov_method)
    This requires domain specific knoledge
or specify some flavor problem-specific of spasity patten to simplify the system
    Auto sparse can compute spasity matrix for you, in Julia

AMS Designer simulator can be invoked from either Virtuoso/Spectre or Xcelium

Using the Spectre/Virtuoso option:
Spectre is highly accurate for small designs,APS is for larger designers
Support for Verilog, Verilog-AMS, ANSI-C/C++, and SV Design and Assertion (but no Real number modeling)

SystemVerilog and Verilog-AMS both have support for real number modeling (called real/wreal, respectively). This is faster, but less performant that SPICE or more complex Verilog-AMS models, because real/wreal models don't require 'solvers'. The IO behavior is simply defined by a function, and is evaluted with simple discrete event solver. Therefor it does not behave well for models that involve feedback.

Unified/Commond Power Format (https://www.techdesignforums.com/practice/guides/unified-power-format-upf/)




Spectre AMS Simulator/Design is not just an interprocess communication between two separate kernels, but instead a pair of tightly coupled enginge which access a shared memory storing the state of the circuit during simulation.

## Hierarchical Structures

Hierarchical structures are a Verilog concept that allow interconnection of modules at different levels of hierarchy. This is essentially the same function as the netlist but defined within a Verilog-A module.

In this phase-locked loop example, all modules and the top level module interconnecting them are in the same file. However this isn't necessary and it is possible to have each Verilog-A module in its own file. In this case a .LOAD statement must be included in the netlist to load all Verilog-A module accessed in the instance statements

#### The main two uses for a AMS language are simulation and synthesis

But the latter isn't really possible with Verilog-AMS. The prior though can be broken down:

1. To model components: Unlike traditional SPICE simulation libraries which only support a limited number of devices, model SPICE simulators which support Verilog-AMS can describe
   1. Basic devices (R, L, C)
   2. Compact models like Gummel-Poon BJT, VBIC BJT, Mextram BJT, MOS3, BSIM3+4, and EKV MOS. BSIM4 is written in a bunch of C files. BSIM-Bulk, the newest version of BSIM is instead a single Verilog-A model.
   3. Functional blocks like ADCs, de/modulators, samplers, filters, etc
   4. Multi-disciplinary components such as sensors, actuators, transducers, etc.
   5. Logic components
   6. Test bench components like sources and monitors?
2. To create testbenches: testbench devices will often not be ideal, so this is perfect for Verilog-A
3. To accelerate simulation: replacing non-examined blocks in each simulation with a more abstract representation. In end, this is part of the testbench, as the
4. To verify mixed-signal simulation
5. To support the top-down design process

recall there a two design pattern for Simulations

Either you Create a `Sim` object immediately
s = Sim(tb=MyTb)

And add all the same attributes as above
p = s.param(name="x", val=5)


Or you create a Sim class, and then decorae it with the @sim function, to get an object.

I want to have an object, and I wnat to know what can be put inside the .save() attribute.

So I shoul look at the class definition.

It has a `attr`, which is a list made from `SimAttr`, which in turm is a Union of

```
SimAttr = Union[Analysis, Control, Options]
```
And I'm interested in the control element

## Spice-Sim Attribute-Union
Control = Union[Include, Lib, Save, Meas, Param, Literal]:

This finally leads us to:

```
class SaveMode(Enum):
    """Enumerated data-saving modes"""

    NONE = "none"
    ALL = "all"
    SELECTED = "selected"


# Union of "save-able" types
SaveTarget = Union[
    SaveMode,  # A `SaveMode`, e.g. `SaveMode.ALL`
    Signal,  # A single `Signal`
    List[Signal],  # A list of `Signal`s
    str,  # A signal signale-name
    List[str],  # A list of signal-names
]


@simattr
@datatype
class Save:
    """Save Control-Element
    Adds content to the target simulation output"""

    targ: SaveTarget
```

# Verilog-A noise sources:

shot noise, poisson process, but becomes gaussian macroscopically
I(d)<+white_noise(2*q*id);


Flicker noise

I(ia)<+flicker_noise((AH*ID2)/f)

(where AH is a constant which depends on the material, and f is the frequency, infact the flicker noise is inversely proportional to it)

# Verilog-A

Verilog-A is the analog component of Verilog-AMS, and can be understood by the SPICE kernel in a AMS simulator.


One important thing to know, is that in Virtuoso, if you want a graphical representation of your system, you need to have “SPICE on top”, with the Verilog-A as only “leaf modules.” I think, as least?

`<+` contribution operators assign (and only assign) values/relations to branch potentials or flows.

starting with ` means something is a compiler directive


functions with $ start are not synthesizable?

base units of time, and the time precision are specified like this:

```
timescale 1s / 1ns
```

It isn't mandatory to use a base of 1 second, but since Verilog-AMS allows SI uni suffixes, we normally stick to this.
The second unit is used for rounding/quantization of the time
And for the output of the $realtime function


Wires:
Must be driven, continous or discrete, continous has a 'discipline' like a voltage/current
'Nets' are wires that move between modules. They can be implicitely created, or explicitely.
Can also be named 'tri' for tristate, and this syntax should just be used to explain that it's a wire that probably can have bus contentions or high-impedance outputs.
