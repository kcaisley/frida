Don't do anything yet, but can you evalute the feasbility of combining my two makefiles into one, int the project root, and then adding even more functionality to 
  it?\
  \
  Therefor the make file would need to:\
  make specs: converting design specs to design parameters (mostly python)\
  make layout: generate layouts a block, given the design parameters, using klayout\
  make netlist: generate spice netlists for specific blocks, given params, using spicelib\
  make spicesim: run a spice level simulation of a generate netlist, using ngspice and associated spice testbenches. Creates .raw files as output, for later analysis.
  make digsim: run a digital testbench on an associated digital design, using iverilog. Generate a .vcd file as output.
  make bevsim: run a python based simulation of the SAR adc, generating .raw files in the same format as the 
  make synth: generate a technology mapped spice nelists, from verilog input files, and parameters from the design paramters file. yosys is used for synthesis, and abc
   is used to map to the chosen pdk library.\
  make flow: This actually maybe shouldn't be in the same file, but we want to use synthesized gate level verilog to gds using OpenRoad flow scripts. Here's the 
  example openroad make file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/refs/heads/master/flow/Makefile
  make analyze: read in .raw files produced by simulations (spice or behavioral), and create plots and other analysis information about the performance of the design.
  make docs: many of the images above are included by markdown files, and this step would then update any other context of these markdown files which is for example 
  generated by the make analyze step\
  make pdf: finally this step would generate a pdf report from the docs, which use pandoc to converter to latex, and then pdflatex to compile. There would be an 
  intermediate step where pdf files from multiple markdown files would be compibinded into the final output. Meaning the lower level latex files would be instantiated 
  in a top level latex file, and this top level would be the .tex file which is actually compiled. The conversion from .md to .tex would use some special .lua files 
  for the table formatting, and to for example convert all .svg included images to the .pdf version being imported instead for better looking pdf support.\
  \
  let's plan this out! and consider the Makefiles at @hdl/Makefile and @docs/tex/Makefile and the one from the open road project linked about to then propose a way to 
  implement this all from a make-based flow which I could use from the top level directory. Also take a stab at also proposing a directory structure to support this 
  pipeline, such that filetypes of the same kind, and for the same purpose are stored in the same directory without any extra file, so that it's easy to see what parts
   of the pipeline have be finished so far. And also so that some form of make clean can target cleaning only specific parts of the pipeline.\
  \
  And lastly, and most importantly: Think harder about this! (than usual) Put your thoughts in a plan.md file, and don't forget to consult the @readme.md for any 
  context of the project if you need it.
